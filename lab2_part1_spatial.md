# Design a Math Kernel in Spatial and Understand Its Performance 

In this lab, we are going to explore more advanced features in Spatial.

We will first go through the details of using controllers. Then we will use the controllers to build an app for accelerating matrix multiplication. We will also learn about how to improve the performance of your design via parallelization and fine-tuning.

More specifically, the elements used in this lab are:

Controllers: MemReduce, MemFold, FSM

On-chip memory components: LUT

Tools for optimizing applications: `PostExecution.html`, fine-tuning the parallelization factors.

# Running the Tests
The `run.sh` file contains the commands to run the tests in this lab. You can run specific tests selectively by commenting out the ones you don't want to run.

```bash
chmod +x ./run.sh   # do this if you see "Permission denied" when trying to run ./run.sh
./run.sh
```
## MemReduce, MemFold
> Code for this section can be found in ``src/test/scala/Lab2Part1.scala``.

A Reduce controller operates on a single register. In contrast, a MemReduce controller operates on a piece of on-chip memory (SRAM). From a high-level point of view, Reduce is designed for scalar operations and MemReduce is designed for tensor operations. You can use MemReduce by using the following syntax:

```scala
// Create a MemReduce Controller
MemReduce(accum_sram)(N by n){ i =>
  // map body
}{// binary operator}
```

For example, you can add a list of arrays by using MemReduce:
```scala
// Create an SRAM to store the reduced results
val a = SRAM[Int](16)
// Add 10 SRAMs together, where each SRAM contains only ones.
MemReduce(a)(-5 until 5 by 1) { i =>
  // Create an SRAM
  val tmp = SRAM[Int](16)
  // For each element in the tmp SRAM, fill it with 1
  Foreach(16 by 1) { j => 
    tmp(j) = 1
  }
  tmp
}{_+_}
```

The end-to-end application will look like:
```scala
// MemReduce
@spatial class Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce extends SpatialTest {

  val N = 16.to[Int]

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val out = DRAM[Int](16)
    Accel {
      val a = SRAM[Int](16)
      MemReduce(a)(-5 until 5 by 1){i =>
        val tmp = SRAM[Int](16)
        Foreach(16 by 1) { j => tmp(j) = 1}
        tmp
      }{_+_}
      out store a
    }

    val result = getMem(out)
    val gold = Array.tabulate(16){i => 10.to[Int]}
    printArray(gold, "expected: ")
    printArray(result, "result:   ")

    val cksum = gold.zip(result){_==_}.reduce{_&&_}
    println("PASS: " + cksum + " (Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce)")
  }
}
```

In the last lab, you used scala simulation to quickly test the functionality of your designs. However, if you want to make sure that your design is [cycle-accurate](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/1191/what-exactly-is-a-cycle-accurate-emulator), you will need to run the VCS simulation. Unlike Scala simulation, VCS simulation generates the Verilog description of your design and runs a cycle-accurate simulation. Compared to Scala simulation, VCS simulation takes longer to complete (because the circuit needs to be simulated at every clock cycle), but it gives a simulation environment that's more similar to what will be running on the board. For example, you can have a design that passes the Scala simulation, but fails the VCS simulation because the circuit that gets generated is not correct. In addition, we can also use the VCS simulation results to help us tune our design.

In order to generate the files for VCS simulation, you need to run the following command in the labs directory:
```bash
 export TEST_ARGS="--name Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce --synth --instrumentation --fpga=VCS"; sbt -Dci=true "; testOnly Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce" 
```
-->

<!-- <img src="./img/gen.png" width="70%" height="60%"> -->

<!-- 
The synthesizable design of your Spatial app is under "gen/Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce". Let's take a look at the generated files.
```bash
cd gen/Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce
ls
``` -->

<!-- <img src="./img/genls.png" width="70%" height="60%"> -->
<!-- The chisel folder contains the RTL code generated from your design. Here are the commands to run VCS simulation:

```bash
# make vcs simulation binary, then redirect the console output to vcs.log
make > vcs.log
# run vcs simulation, then redirect the console output to dramsim.log. 
bash run.sh "" > dramsim.log
```

If your application expects any runtime arguments you can include them within the quotation marks, separated by a space.
For example, if your application is expecting to take in two integers, your command would look like:
```bash
bash run.sh "3 5" > dramsim.log
```

VCS simulation will start. Wait till the simulation completes, and you can view the simulation results by running: -->

<!-- After the simulation finishes, you will see the following messages:
![vcs](./img/vcs.png)
To view the simulation result, run: 
```bash
cat dramsim.log
```
![dramsim](./img/dramsimre.png) -->

<!-- This file should show that your app is simulated successfully and tell you how many cycles it ran for. Now we can clean up the VCS simulation directory.

```bash
cd ../../
rm -rf gen/Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce
``` 

Now we can start deploying your design on an FPGA board. For your projects we will use the Alveo U250 Data Center Acceleration Card as our platform, but for now we can target the Xilinx ZC706 FPGA to get an idea of how to generate a bitstream and look at the resource utilization of our design. Before synthesizing, we need to do a bit more setup. First, we need to start a [screen](https://kb.iu.edu/d/acuy) session to run the synthesizer. This way, you can keep the job running even when you sign off the server. The following command starts a screen session called Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce.
```bash
screen -S Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce
```

In the screen session, you need to first generate a design for your FPGA. Go back to the labs directory, and run the following command:
```bash
export TEST_ARGS="--name Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce --synth --instrumentation --fpga=zynq"; sbt -Dci=true "; testOnly Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce"
```

Then, go to the generated folder and run make:
```bash
cd gen/Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce
make | tee make.log
```

The "tee" command would log the output from the synthesizer to "make.log".
After you start the synthesizer, you can detach the screen session by pressing "Ctrl+A D". You can view the running screen sessions by using the command "screen -ls". To reattach a screen session, you can run "screen -r SESSIONNAME". -->


<!-- <img src="./img/screenjobs.png" width="70%" height="60%"> -->

<!-- The synthesis process would take ~20 min to run. After the synthesis finishes, you will have access to the bitstream and reports of your design's resource utilization on the target FPGA. The report is located in labs/gen/Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce/verilog-zynq/ (if you are using a zcu, you need to go to verilog-zcu). The resource utilization report is named "par_utilization.rpt", and it contains information that looks like this:

### Your Turn
<!-- * Synthesize the example application. Report on the resource utilization and
cycle counts. -->
We also have a `MemFold` controller, which looks very similar to fold but operates on memories. In this part of the exercise, your task is to reimplement `Lab2Part1SimpleMemReduce` using `MemFold`. Fill in the commented `TODO` section in the `Lab2Part1.scala` file under the class name `Lab2Part2SimpleMemFold`.

Make sure that you intialize your SRAM before passing it to the `MemFold` controller. Like `Fold`, `MemFold` assumes that you have intialized your `MemFold` SRAM beforehand.

## FSM
> Code for this section can be found in ``src/test/scala/Lab2Part3.scala``.

Spatial also supports using Finite State Machine by instantiating an FSM controller. It
has the following syntax:
```scala
FSM(// initial condition)(// constraint on the state) { state =>
  // Body of the state machine
}{ // rules for generating the next state }
```

For example, if you want to fill an SRAM of size 32 using the following rules: 
* If index of the SRAM is greater than or equal to 16: 
  * If index == 16, set the element at the location (index - 16) to the value 17.
  * If index == 17, set the element at the location (index - 16) to reg.value.
  * Otherwise, set the element at location (index - 16) to be the value of the index you are currently on.
* If index is smaller than 16:
  * If index < 8, set the element at the location (31 - index) to be index
  * Otherwise, set the element at the location (31 - index) to be index + 1

You will need to implement it in Spatial that looks like:
```scala
reg := 16
FSM(0)(state => state < 32) { state =>
  if (state < 16) {
    if (state < 8) {
      bram(31 - state) = state // 16:31 [7, 6, ... 0]
    } else {
      bram(31 - state) = state+1 // 16:31 [16, 15, ... 9]
    }
  }
  else {
    bram(state - 16) = if (state == 16) 17 else if (state == 17) reg.value else state
  }
}{state => state + 1}
```

An example of the end-to-end application looks like:
```scala
@spatial class Lab2Part3BasicCondFSM extends SpatialTest {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val dram = DRAM[Int](32)
    Accel {
      val bram = SRAM[Int](32)
      val reg = Reg[Int](0)
      reg := 16
      FSM(0)(state => state < 32) { state =>
        if (state < 16) {
          if (state < 8) {
            bram(31 - state) = state // 16:31 [7, 6, ... 0]
          } else {
            bram(31 - state) = state+1 // 16:31 [16, 15, ... 9]
          }
        }
        else {
          bram(state - 16) = if (state == 16) 17 else if (state == 17) reg.value else state // Test const, regread, and bound Mux1H
        }
      }{state => state + 1}

      dram(0::32 par 16) store bram
    }
    val result = getMem(dram)
    val gold = Array[Int](17, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
                          29, 30, 31, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)
    printArray(result, "Result")
    printArray(gold, "Gold")
    val cksum = gold.zip(result){_ == _}.reduce{_&&_}
    println("PASS: " + cksum + " (BasicCondFSM)")
  }
}
```

### Your Turn
<!-- * Synthesize the example application. Report on the resource utilization and
cycle counts. The example application is stored as Lab2Part3BasicCondFSM. -->
Let's try a different example. Here is the set of rules:

Fill an SRAM of size 32 using the following rules:
* If the index of the SRAM is smaller than 8
  * Set the element at index to be index
* If the index of the SRAM is within \[8, 16\)
  * Set the element at index to be index * 2
* If the index of the SRAM is within \[16, 24\)
  * Set the element at index to be index * 3
* Otherwise
  * Set the element at index to be index * 4

Fill in the commented `TODO` section for `Lab2Part3BasicCondFSMAlt` in the `Lab2Part3.scala` file.

## LUT
> Code for this section can be found in ``src/test/scala/Lab2Part4.scala``.

A LUT has the following syntax:
```scala
val lut = LUT[Type](N0,N1, ..., Nm)(const0.to[T], const1.to[T], ...)
```
The `(N0,N1, ..., Nm)` is the size of each dimension and `(const0.to[T], const1.to[T], ...)` is the initialization values. The values will be initialized in a row major order. 

This creates a LUT of `m` dimensions. Given that `m` is 4, you can access an element in lut by
using:
```scala
val lut_ijmn = lut(i,j,m,n)
```
Therefore, `lut(0,0,0,0)` will be `const0` and `lut(0,0,0,1)` will be `const1`. 


### Your Turn
* Please use the LUT syntax to implement the app in `Lab2Part4LUT` which is under the ``Lab2Part4.scala`` file. The LUT is 3 by 3 filled with integers from 1 to 9.  What we want
to do here is that given a LUT, the user will provide a base value, index i and
index j. The output should be base value + LUT(i,j). 
<!-- No need to synthesize this application, but make sure it passes scala and VCS sim and include the VCS cycle count.
```scala
// Copy-paste your implementation here
``` -->

## Designing An Accelerator for Matrix Multiplication
General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) is a common algorithm in linear algebra, machine learning, statistics, and many other domains. It provides a more interesting trade-off space than
the previous tutorial, as there are many ways to break up the computation. This includes
using blocking, outer products, and systolic array techniques. In this tutorial,
we will demonstrate how to build a blocked GEMM application using outer products.

### Data Setup and Validation
Let's start by creating the data structures above the Accel that we will set up the matrices and compute the
gold check. We will expose the dimensions of the matrices as command-line arguments.
```scala
import spatial.dsl._

@spatial class GEMM extends SpatialTest {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  
    type T = FixPt[TRUE,_24,_8]
    
    // Reading in arguments for the dimensions of the matrices
    val M = ArgIn[Int]
    val N = ArgIn[Int]
    val K = ArgIn[Int]
    setArg(M,args(0).to[Int])
    setArg(N,args(1).to[Int])
    setArg(K,args(2).to[Int])
    
    // Declaring & Initializing the input matrices and output matrix
    val a_data = (0::args(0).to[Int], 0::args(2).to[Int]){(i,j) => random[T](3)}
    val b_data = (0::args(2).to[Int], 0::args(1).to[Int]){(i,j) => random[T](3)}
    val c_init = (0::args(0).to[Int], 0::args(1).to[Int]){(i,j) => 0.to[T]}
    val a = DRAM[T](M, K) // input matrix 1
    val b = DRAM[T](K, N) // input matrix 2
    val c = DRAM[T](M, N) // an initial matrix for the result
    
    setMem(a, a_data)
    setMem(b, b_data)
    setMem(c, c_init)
    
    Accel {
      // TODO: Set up accelerator code for MatMult
    }
    
    val accel_matrix = getMatrix(c)
    
    // Gold calculation & checking
    val gold_matrix = (0::args(0).to[Int], 0::args(1).to[Int]){(i,j) => 
      Array.tabulate(args(2).to[Int]){k => a_data(i,k) * b_data(k,j)}.reduce{_+_}
    }
    
    printMatrix(accel_matrix, "Received: ")
    printMatrix(gold_matrix, "Wanted: ")
    val cksum = accel_matrix.zip(gold_matrix){_==_}.reduce{_&&_}
    println("Pass? " + cksum)
  }
}
```

Notice that we create an initial matrix for the result and set all values to 0.  This is necessary
because GEMM using outer products computes part of a tile of the result and accumulates this on top 
of what was previously in that tile.  This means we will need to fetch a tile from off-chip DRAM
and accumulate a new result on top of that, then write this new tile back.


### Outer Products
The animation below shows how to compute GEMM without tiling, using outer products.

![imageGemm](./img/gemmfull.gif)

Because we cannot create hardware to handle variable-sized matrices, we must tile the problem.
The animation below shows one valid scheme for doing so.  We will set our tile sizes in the
M, N, and K dimensions above the Accel as follows
```scala
val tileM = 16
val tileN = 16
val tileK = 16
```

![imageGemmTile](./img/gemmtile.gif)

Now let's write the code to implement this computation.  The large arrows and boxes represent
matrix multiplies on the highlighted tiles using outer products.  There will be six nested loops:
one for each dimension of tiling and one for each dimension within the tile.  

Considering the tiling loops first, this particular animation shows that we are treating the N dimension
as the innermost loop, followed by the M dimension, and finally the K dimension. Below shows the nested 
loops along with the data structures and their tile transfers required within each scope.  
```scala
Accel {
  Foreach(K by tileK){kk => 
    val numel_k = min(tileK.to[Int], K - kk)
    Foreach(M by tileM){mm =>
      val numel_m = min(tileM.to[Int], M - mm)
      val tileA_sram = SRAM[T](tileM, tileK)
      tileA_sram load a(mm::mm+numel_m, kk::kk+numel_k)
      Foreach(N by tileN){nn =>
        val numel_n = min(tileN.to[Int], N - nn)
        val tileB_sram = SRAM[T](tileK, tileN)
        val tileC_sram = SRAM[T](tileM, tileN).buffer
        tileB_sram load b(kk::kk+numel_k, nn::nn+numel_n)
        tileC_sram load c(mm::mm+numel_m, nn::nn+numel_n)

        // Implement the full outer product here

        c(mm::mm+numel_m, nn::nn+numel_n) store tileC_sram
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that we must compute the ``numel_k,numel_m,numel_n`` values to handle the edge cases correct, when the tile dimensions
do not evenly divide the full matrices.

Also note that we declare ``tileC_sram`` as a `.buffer` SRAM.  If you do not declare it this way,
the compiler will throw an error about this and explain the issue.  You will learn more about
this in the `Advanced Buffering`

Next, we will implement the full outer product of the tiles that we have brought into the chip.

### Your Turn
In every iteration of the innermost Foreach, we bring in two SRAMs of data.
From the animation, you should have seen how we use the two SRAMs to populate a
third one, and then write it back to Matrix C. In the comment section("Implement the full outer product here"), please
implement this design. As a little hint, you should first think of the proper
controller to use. Here are some behaviors of tiling and outer product that would help you figure out the proper controllers to use.
  * Output Product: Given two input matrices, it computes a matrix using a column of the first matrix and a row of the second matrix. This is repeated ``numel_k`` times and the output **matrices** will be **accumulated**.
  * Tiling: You need to accumulate the results from the input tiles that are computing for the same output tile.

You can add your implementation to the ``Lab2Part5GEMM`` in the `Lab2GEMM.scala` file.

### Advanced Buffering
This section will explain why we had to add the ``buffer`` flag for ``tileC_sram`` in the previous section. To put in a nutshell, this is to annotate that we are going to use this SRAM as a triple buffer (You can think of this as similar to a double buffer).
This Accel above already implements coarse-grain pipelining at various levels.  For example, the controller whose counter is ``nn`` has 
three stages in it.  
1) Load ``tileB_sram`` and ``tileC_sram`` in parallel
2) Perform the computation into ``tileC_sram``
3) Write the resulting ``tileC_sram`` back into the appropriate region of DRAM.  
This is an example where the compiler will create a triple-buffer for ``tileC_sram`` in order to ensure that the correct values are being worked with
when this coarse-grain pipeline fills up and executes.  

If you had not declared ``tileC_sram`` as a `.buffer` SRAM, then the compiler is suspicious of your code.  This is because it is generally
very easy when specifying pipelined hardware to accidentally create loop-carry dependency issues.  Specifically, in this code, it sees that
you write to the SRAM in the first stage, and then write to it again in the second stage.  It is very easy, even for advanced users, to
write this kind of structure without realizing it and then receive an incorrect result when using a cycle-accurate simulator of the hardware
because of values "rotating" through the buffer inadvertently.

The animation below specifically demonstrates the triple buffer ``tileC_sram`` in this algorithm.

![imageTripleBuf](./img/triplebuf.gif)

Note that at the beginning and end of each row, there are a few iterations where parts of the buffer are not being used.
This is because of the way the loops are written, such that we step through each tile in the N dimension before we
increment the tile for M.  If you want to write the app such that there are no wasteful fill and drain iterations,
you must combine loops appropriately.


### Understanging Performance

Now that you have finished writing an algorithm, you will want to try to improve performance. As we have seen in lab 1, you can get the cycle count for each controller through the `gen/CS217/Lab2Part5GEMM/info/PostExecution.html`. 

### Your Turn
Let's try to parallelize the code you wrote in the previous section for matrix multiply. Add a proper parallelization factor to the controllers you used to implement the outer product computation.
You can add parallelization factors as shown below. For more detailed example for parallelizing your design, refer to the case study we went through in lecture 4.

```scala
val data = DRAM[Int](32)
Accel {
  val input = SRAM[Int](32)
  val output = SRAM[Int](32)
  input load data
  Foreach(0 until 32 par 16) {i =>
  output(i) = input(i) * 2
}
data store output
```

* Add your implementation to the commented section (`TODO: Implement the full outer product here`) of ``Lab2Part6GEMM`` in the `Lab2GEMM.scala` file.
* In ``lab2-part6.md``, answer the questions based on the performence gain you observed in `gen/CS217/Lab2Part6GEMM/info/PostExecution.html`.  The answers don't have to be lengthy. Just try to provide the information the questions ask.

## Submission
You should add the following implementation to each file and fill in ``lab2-part6.md``.
* In `Lab2Part1.scala`: Fill in the commented `TODO` section in `Lab2Part2SimpleMemFold`. For more detail, refer to [MemReduce, MemFold section](#your-turn)

Submit a report answering the following question.
> With the information from the controller tree results, can you set the parallelization differently to get the fewest clock cycle for your GEMM? What is the smallest cycle number you can get after tuning the application?

Trying to get the fewest clock cycle as possible is desired, but rather than the number of clock cycles itself, we are more interested to see your thought process of coming up with the proper parallelization factors based on your analysis of the performance information you get.

To show this, please include the following details in the report:
* **You initial performance before modifying the parallelization factor**: A screenshot of the controller tree mentioned in [this section](#understanging-performance)
* **How you plan to modify the parallelization factor & Why**
* **How the performance changed after modifying the parallelization factor**: A screenshot of the controller tree and a breif explanation of which parts improved.


## Extra Credits (5 points out of 100)
* In lecture, we covered about how to tune the parallelization factors of controllers to improve the performance of dot product. Can you do the same for GEMM? What is the fewest number of cycles you can achieve? What is your reasoning on choosing your embedded memory size and parallelization factors?
